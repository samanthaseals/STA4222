## 1.1: Introduction

- [Definition of **statistics**](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/statistics): *the science that deals with the collection, classification, analysis, and interpretation of numerical facts or data, and that, by use of mathematical theories of probability, imposes order and regularity on aggregates of more or less disparate elements.*

## 1.1: Introduction

- Data is used to make decisions.

    - Test driving a car before purchasing.
    
    - Menu options at a restaurant when choosing where to eat.
    
    - Your and peers' experiences with professors when choosing what classes to take.
    
    - Star rating and written reviews of items on Amazon.
    
- Formal data collection and analysis is crucial for decisions that affect lives.

    - Medicine
    
    - Politics
    
    - Ecology

## 1.2: Populations and Representative Samples

- It is often not possible to take a census, thus, we want to draw samples that are representative of the population.

- **Observation unit**: an object on which a measurement is taken, sometimes called an **element**.

    - individual person; 
    - small area of land; 
    - financial records.
    
- **Target population**: the complete collection of observations under study; the choice of target population affects the resulting statistics.

    - all adults eligible to vote; 
    - all registered voters;
    - all that voted in the last election.

## 1.2: Populations and Representative Samples

- **Sample**: a subset of the population.

- **Sampled population**: the collection of all possible observation units that might have been chosen for a sample; the population from which the sample was taken.

- **Sampling unit**: a unit that can be selected for a sample.

    - Sometimes, households serve as the sampling units while the individuals living in the household are teh observation units.
    
- **Sampling frame**: a list, map, or other specification of sampling units in the population from which a sample may be selected.

    - e.g., a list of telephone numbers of registered voters; a list of all farms; a list of student identification numbers.

## 1.2: Populations and Representative Samples

- Ideally, the sample population will be identical to the target population... but this rarely happens.

- When the target population and sampled population do not match, the sample may be unrepresentative.

    - This introduces bias to the statistics calculated from the sample data.
    
- **Bias**: a systematic error in the sampling, measurement, or estimation procedures that results in a statistic being either consistently larger or smaller thant he population characteristic it is estimating.

- Bias will always be present, which is why it is important to recognize that it is present when interpreting data.

- In this course, we will discuss three types of bias:

    - Selection
    
    - Measurement
    
    - Estimation
    
## 1.3: Selection Bias

- **Selection bias**: the target population does not coincide with the sampled population; some population units are sampled at a different rate than intended.

    - e.g., a survey designed to study household income has fewer low-income households than a representative sample, so the survey estimates of average or median income will be too large.
    
- Broadly, selection bias occurs under the following situations:

    - convenience samples
    - purposive or judgement samples
    - self-selected samples
    - undercoverage
    - overcoverage
    - nonresponse
    
## 1.3: Selection Bias
    
- **Convenience samples**: sampling the first set of population units encountered.

- **Purposive or judgment samples**: deliberately or purposively selecting a "representative" sample.

- **Self-selected sample**: contains only volunteers; people are selecting themselves to be in the sample.

- In all cases, the sampled units may differ from other units in the population on the measures being studied.

    - The sample may be associated with a characteristic being studied.

## 1.3: Selection Bias

- **Undercoverage**: the sampling frame does not include all members of the target population.

    - If units are not included in the frame, the probability of their selection is 0. 
    
    - The resulting statistics may be biased, depending on how severe the undercoverage is.

- **Overcoverage**: units not in the target population are included in the sample. 

    - If a sampling frame is hard to construct, a larger sampling frame will be used for screening purposes.
    
        - e.g., households with toddlers
    
    - Overcoverage happens when units that do not belong to the target population are *not* screened out.

- **Nonresponse**: failing to obtain responses from some units from the chosen sample.

    - Studies have shown that there are inherent differences between those that do and do not respond.

## 1.4: Measurement Error

- **Measurement error**: the response differs from the true value.

- **Measurement bias**: responses tend to differ from the true value in one direction.

- Why does measurement error/bias happen?

    - Untruthful responses.

    - Forgetfulness.
    
    - Understanding of question.
    
    - Perceived tone of question.
    
    - Perception of question based on mode of delivery.
    
    - Answering with what the researcher "wants" to hear.
    
    - Question order.

## 1.5: Questionnaire Design

- Test the questions before launching the survey.

- Simple and clear questions.

- Define terms.

    e.g., The [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) asks the following question, *How many separate rooms are in this house, apartment, or mobile home? Rooms must be separated by built-in archways or walls that extend out at least 6 inches and go from floor to ceiling. Include bedrooms, kitchens, etc. Exclude bathrooms, porches, balconies, foyers, halls, or unfinished basements.*
    
- Decide if open or closed questions will be used.
    

## 1.5: Questionnaire Design

- Avoid leading or loaded questions -- these prompt or motivate the respondent to answer in a particular way.

- Analyze the social desirability of responses to questions.

    - Write and ask questions in a way that will increase accuracy of responses.

- Avoid double negatives.

- Use forced choice instead of agree/disagree questions.

- Only ask about one concept per question.

- Consider question order effects.
